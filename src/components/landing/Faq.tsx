    q: "Does checking my loan eligibility affect my CIBIL score?",
    a: "No — checking your loan eligibility on Aapka Credit performs a soft credit inquiry, which does not appear on your CIBIL or Experian credit report and has zero impact on your credit score. Only when you formally accept the sanction letter and complete loan agreement signing does an official enquiry occur.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the maximum loan amount I can get approved for?",
    a: "Eligible borrowers can receive sanctions up to ₹5,00,000 for personal loans, and up to ₹50,00,000 for MSME business loans. The approved limit is calculated in real time based on your declared monthly income, banking cash flows, and credit profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "How fast is the money transferred to my bank account?",
    a: "Once you complete 100% digital KYC and penny-drop bank verification, funds are disbursed via instant IMPS 24x7. In over 90% of cases, borrowers see the funds credited in their bank account within 5 to 10 minutes.",
  },
  {
    q: "What documents are required to apply?",
    a: "Aapka Credit requires zero physical photocopies. You only need: 1) Aadhaar number for DigiLocker XML verification, 2) PAN Card number for instant NSDL verification, 3) Bank account details for automated penny-drop verification, and 4) Live selfie photo.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the interest rates and repayment tenures?",
    a: "Annual interest rates start from 10.49% p.a. depending on your risk tier and credit history. Repayment tenures are flexible and range from 3 months up to 60 months with easy monthly EMIs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are there any foreclosure or prepayment penalties?",
    a: "No! Following RBI digital lending best practices, you can close or prepay your loan anytime without any prepayment penalties or hidden closure charges.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who is the lending partner for Aapka Credit?",
    a: "Loans facilitated on Aapka Credit are sanctioned and disbursed directly by RBI-registered Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) compliant with the Reserve Bank of India's Digital Lending Guidelines.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I make monthly EMI repayments?",
    a: "You can set up one-time automated debit via NPCI e-Mandate / e-NACH, or pay manually anytime using UPI apps (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm), Net Banking, or Debit Card.",
  },
